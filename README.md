## Layouts

### Horizontal
This layout has one column per window, with each window extending the full height of the screen.

### Vertical
The rotated version of Column, where each window takes up an entire row, extending the full width of the screen.

### HorizontalGrid
This layout places the windows in grid occuping space in horizontal when necessary.

### VerticalGrid
This layout places the windows in grid occuping space in vertical when necessary.

### Monocle
In this layout, the currently focused window takes up the entire screen, and the other windows are not visible at all.

### Wide
The rotated version of tall.

### Tall
The default layout. This gives you one "main pane" on the left, and one other pane on the right. The main window is placed in the main pane (extending the full height of the screen), and all remaining windows are placed in the other pane. The main pane can be shrinked/expanded.
